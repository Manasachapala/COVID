# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project performs an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on global COVID-19 data using Python and Matplotlib.  
The goal is to uncover trends, compare countries, analyze fatality and recovery rates, and explore correlations between key metrics. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, visualization, and analytical skills relevant for data-driven research.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle â€“ COVID-19 Report](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report)  
- **Description:** Country-level COVID-19 data including confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and new daily changes.  
- **Columns include:** Country, Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, Active, New cases, New deaths, New recovered, Deaths/100 Cases, Recovered/100 Cases, etc.

## Analysis Performed
- Identification of the **top 10 most affected countries** by confirmed cases.  
- Calculation of **fatality rates** and **recovery rates** for each country.  
- **Correlation analysis** between confirmed, active, recovered, and death cases to identify relationships.  
- Summary of key insights and patterns in global COVID-19 data.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## How to Run
1. Download the notebook and dataset.  
2. Open the notebook in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.  
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Key Insights
- Countries like USA, India, and Brazil had the **highest confirmed cases**.  
- Fatality and recovery rates vary significantly between countries, indicating differences in healthcare infrastructure and policy responses.  
- Strong correlations exist between confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, showing proportional relationships between these metrics.
